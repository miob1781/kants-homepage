            <p>Welcome to my page! I am a philosopher based in KÃ¶nigsberg, Prussia. My work covers most areas of systematic philosophy. I used to dabble in theoretical physics as well.</p>
            <p>At the heart of my philosophical project is what I call the "critical" approach. This means that we have to investigate our cognitive faculties to determine the reach and limits of our human cognition. I have applied this to both theoretical and practical philosophy, bringing the metaphysics of nature and of morals to completion.</p>
            <p>You may also know me for my engagement in current intellectual debates in the spirit of enlightenment and societal progress. I have argued for free speech, the freedom and independence of philosophical faith, republicanism, and eternal peace.</p>
